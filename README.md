An EVM records a vote through electronic means. The machine records no personal information and ensures the complete anonymity of the individual casting his/her ballot.An EVM is designed with two units: the control unit and the balloting unit. These units are joined together by a cable. The control unit of the EVM is kept with the presiding officer or the polling officer. The balloting unit is kept within the voting compartment for electors to cast their votes. This is done to ensure that the polling officer verifies your identity. With the EVM, instead of issuing a ballot paper, the polling officer will press the Ballot Button which enables the voter to cast their vote. A list of candidates’ names and/or symbols will be available on the machine with a button next to it. The voter can press the button next to the candidate’s name they wish to vote for.
